# Description
This is a **simple Nodejs** API with Typescript. It uses Express as the web framework and Types to easily convert the installed js packages to typescript. It's functionality is simply based on the Authentification of users, Create, Read, Update and Delete a user, while using middlewares to authenticate and confirm a user has the rights to update and delete their account.

## Getting Started
